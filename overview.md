# Post to Office365 Connector

Send messages to Microsoft Teams and Office 365 Groups

## Get Started
First up, you need to [access the connectors for either Microsoft Teams or Office 365](https://dev.outlook.com/Connectors) create yourself an incoming webhook.

Once the webhook is set up, copy the webhook URL to the corresponding field in the build/release task.

For the other fields, you are able to use [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), as well as [build variables](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/define/variables), to fully customize your message.
